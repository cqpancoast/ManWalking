Platformer demo I made in Unity over winter break, 2018.

Inspired by a (now-disappeared) video that [this one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S36CH4cbW1A) includes first in its compilation, I wanted to know how I would go about making a basic 3D platformer.

I implemented my drawn model in Blender, then added animations. Other than the model, I kept everything pretty bare-bones.
